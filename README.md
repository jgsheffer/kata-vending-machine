Vending Machine Kata
====================
_submitted by Jared Sheffer -- jgsheffe@gmail.com_

Running
-------
To run the application simply open your command window  
  from the root project directory you may click to open or execute:  
 `java vendingMachine_main.jar`  
 
 
 A Swing window should open with a representation of the vending machine functionality.

Building
-------

If you wish to run the tests or compile the code I would recommend using IntelliJ.  
Load the project and navigate to src-> main ->java -> right click on VendingMachineGui.java and select run.

You may execute the tests from intellij by going to src-> test right click on java and select 'Run All Tests'

Alternatively you may run build and test through a command line.

From the root folder run:
 
`./gradlew clean build`  from terminal  
`gradlew.bat clean build` from cmd  


 Notes
 -----
 This uses some intillij swing objects so there is a possibility it might not be able to compile without intellij  
 being installed.  I do not have a PC without intellij so I am unable to test to confirm this but it is something  
 to note.
